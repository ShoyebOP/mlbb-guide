            <h2>Uranus: The Stalwart Guardian - MLBB Guide</h2>
            <p>Alright, let's craft a comprehensive Uranus guide for Mobile Legends: Bang Bang.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Uranus is primarily a <strong>EXP Laner</strong>, excelling in sustained fights and soaking up damage. While his main role is EXP Lane, he can situationally be played as a <strong>Roamer</strong> focused on disruption and initiation.</h3>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>I. Role Overview & Playstyle</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>EXP Lane (Main):</strong> Uranus thrives in the EXP Lane due to his strong sustain and wave clear. He can pressure the enemy, survive ganks, and force rotations. He’s a great pick against heroes who rely on short bursts of damage or who struggle to deal with high regeneration. He’s all about out-sustaining your opponent, securing lane dominance, and scaling into a mid-game threat.</li>
                <li><strong>Roamer (Situational):</strong> As a Roamer, Uranus focuses on initiating fights, providing vision, and disrupting the enemy's backline. He’s less about dealing damage and more about being an unkillable nuisance. His high mobility (with Flicker) and tankiness make him surprisingly effective at setting up plays. This pick is more niche and relies heavily on team coordination.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>II. EXP Lane Builds</h3>
            <p><strong>Build Philosophy:</strong> The core of an EXP Lane Uranus build is maximizing his HP, Regen, and defensive capabilities.</p>
            <h4>Build 1: The Standard Sustain Build</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Emblem:</strong> Tank Emblem
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Talents:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Tier 1: Vitality (Extra HP)</li>
                                <li>Tier 2: Brave Smite (HP Regen when dealing damage with basic attacks)</li>
                                <li>Tier 3: Tenacity (Increases Physical and Magic Defense when under crowd control)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Build Order:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li><img src="images/build items/Tough_Boots.png" alt="Tough Boots">/<img src="images/build items/Warrior_Boots.png" alt="Warrior Boots"> <strong>Tough Boots/Warrior Boots:</strong> (Magic Resist/Physical Defense - Choose based on enemy lane opponent)</li>
                        <li><img src="images/build items/Radiant_Armor.png" alt="Radiant Armor"> <strong>Radiant Armor:</strong> (High HP, Magic Defense, and reduces Magic Damage over time. Essential against sustained Magic Damage dealers.)</li>
                        <li><img src="images/build items/Dominance_Ice.png" alt="Dominance Ice"> <strong>Dominance Ice:</strong> (Reduces enemy movement speed and attack speed. Provides Mana, Physical Defense, and Cooldown Reduction. Helps with anti-heal.)</li>
                        <li><img src="images/build items/Oracle.png" alt="Oracle"> <strong>Oracle:</strong> (Increases shield absorption and HP regen effects. Synergizes perfectly with Uranus's passive and skills.)</li>
                        <li><img src="images/build items/Immortality.png" alt="Immortality"> <strong>Immortality:</strong> (Gives a second life. Crucial for late-game team fights.)</li>
                        <li><img src="images/build items/Antique_Cuirass.png" alt="Antique Cuirass"> <strong>Antique Cuirass:</strong> (Reduces enemy Physical Attack damage. Great against high-damage Physical heroes.)</li>

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This build maximizes Uranus's sustain, making him incredibly difficult to kill. Radiant Armor is key against mages, Dominance Ice cripples the enemy carry, and Oracle amplifies his already impressive regeneration.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>IV. General Uranus Tips & Tricks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Skill Priority:</strong> Max Skill 2 (Ionic Edge) first. It's your primary wave clear and poke tool. Then, max Skill 1 (Radiant Orb). Your ultimate is your lifeline, so use it wisely.</li>
                <li><strong>Teamfighting:</strong> Engage with Flicker + Ultimate. Disrupt the enemy backline, soak up damage, and let your team follow up.</li>
                <li><strong>Laning Phase:</strong> Use Skill 2 to clear waves quickly. Poke with Skill 1 when possible. Don't be afraid to trade blows; your regen will often win you the exchange.</li>
                <li><strong>Itemization is Key:</strong> Adapt your build based on the enemy team composition. Don't blindly follow a single build path.</li>
                <li><strong>Learn to Manage Mana:</strong> Uranus can be mana-hungry in the early game. Be mindful of your mana usage and don't spam skills unnecessarily.</li>
                <li><strong>Ultimate Timing:</strong> Use your ultimate proactively, not reactively. Don't wait until you're almost dead to activate it. Use it to initiate fights or to survive sustained damage.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>V. Counters & Synergies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Counters:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Anti-Heal:</strong> Heroes with anti-heal skills (e.g., Baxia, Guinevere with Necklace of Durance) severely cripple Uranus's sustain. Dominance Ice can help to mitigate this.</li>
                        <li><strong>Burst Damage:</strong> While Uranus is tanky, he can still be blown up by heroes with extremely high burst damage, especially if he gets crowd controlled.</li>
                        <li><strong>Heroes that ignore defense:</strong> True damage heroes like Karina and Lunox.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Synergies:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Crowd Control:</strong> Uranus benefits greatly from allies who can provide crowd control, allowing him to stick to targets and deal sustained damage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Damage Dealers:</strong> Uranus excels at creating opportunities for his team's damage dealers to shine. He works well with assassins, marksmen, and mages who can capitalize on his initiations and tanking.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>VI. Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>Uranus is a strong and versatile hero who can be a valuable asset to any team. By understanding his strengths and weaknesses, and by adapting your build and playstyle to the specific situation, you can become a formidable Uranus player. Good luck in the Land of Dawn!</p>
