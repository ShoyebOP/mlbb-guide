            <h2>Granger: The Death Sonata - A Comprehensive Guide</h2>
            <p>Okay, here's a comprehensive MLBB guide for Granger, focusing on his primary and secondary lane roles, builds, emblems, talents, and counter items.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Primary Role: Jungler</h3>
            <h3>Secondary Role: Gold Laner (Somewhat situational, requires good farming and positioning)</h3>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Role Overview:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Jungler:</strong> Granger excels as a Jungler due to his high burst damage, strong early-mid game presence, and ability to quickly clear jungle camps. He is a snowball-dependent hero and needs to get ahead early to carry the game.</li>
                <li><strong>Gold Laner:</strong> Granger <em>can</em> be played in the Gold Lane, but it's generally less optimal. He is vulnerable to ganks and needs excellent farming skills to keep up with dedicated Marksman. It's best to pick Granger Gold Lane if the enemy is a weak laner like a mage or a tank.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>I. Jungler Builds:</h3>
            <h4>Core Items (for both builds below):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><img src="images/build items/Hunter's_Knife.png" alt="Hunter's Knife"> <strong>Hunter's Knife (Then upgrade to Raptor Machete/Swift Boots):</strong> Essential for Jungling.</li>
                <li><img src="images/build items/Blade_of_Despair.png" alt="Blade of Despair"> <strong>Blade of Despair:</strong> Core damage item, provides massive physical attack.</li>
                <li><img src="images/build items/Berserker%27s_Fury.png" alt="Berserker's Fury"> <strong>Berserker's Fury:</strong> Critical strike chance and damage.</li>
                <li><img src="images/build items/Malefic_Roar.png" alt="Malefic Roar"> <strong>Malefic Roar:</strong> For armor penetration.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Build 1: High Damage Burst (Aggressive Early Game)</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Build Order:</strong> Raptor Machete > Swift Boots > Blade of Despair > Berserker's Fury > Malefic Roar > Endless Battle</li>
                <li><strong>Emblem:</strong> Assassin
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Talent:</strong> Killing Spree (Restore HP and Movement Speed on Kill)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This build focuses on maximizing burst damage for quick kills and dominating early game ganks. Killing Spree helps sustain you in team fights and skirmishes.</p>
            <h5>Build 2: Sustained Damage (Late Game Focus)</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Build Order:</strong> Raptor Machete > Swift Boots > Blade of Despair > Berserker's Fury > Malefic Roar > Immortality</li>
                <li><strong>Emblem:</strong> Assassin
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Talent:</strong> High and Dry (Increased damage when near only one enemy hero)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This build sacrifices some immediate burst for more sustained damage and survivability. Immortality provides a second chance in team fights. High and Dry provides huge damage if you encounter enemy heroes alone which usually the case for junglers.</p>
            <p><strong>When to Use Which Build:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Build 1:</strong> Use when your team needs early game pressure and you are confident in getting ahead.</li>
                <li><strong>Build 2:</strong> Use when the enemy team is tankier, the game is likely to go late, and you need more survivability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>II. Gold Lane Builds:</h3>
            <h4>Core Items (for both builds below):</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><img src="images/build items/Swift_Boots.png" alt="Swift Boots"> <strong>Swift Boots:</strong> Attack Speed and movement speed.</li>
                <li><img src="images/build items/Blade_of_Despair.png" alt="Blade of Despair"> <strong>Blade of Despair:</strong> Core damage item, provides massive physical attack.</li>
                <li><img src="images/build items/Berserker%27s_Fury.png" alt="Berserker's Fury"> <strong>Berserker's Fury:</strong> Critical strike chance and damage.</li>
                <li><img src="images/build items/Endless_Battle.png" alt="Endless Battle"> <strong>Endless Battle:</strong> True Damage, Mana Regen, and Cooldown Reduction.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Build 1: Classic Marksman (Safe)</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Build Order:</strong> Swift Boots > Blade of Despair > Berserker's Fury > Endless Battle > Windtalker > Immortality</li>
                <li><strong>Emblem:</strong> Marksman
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Talent:</strong> Weakness Finder (Basic attacks have a chance to reduce target's movement speed)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A safer, more standard Gold Lane build that prioritizes sustained damage, attack speed, and some movement speed. The talent Weakness Finder is good for utility and to catch up to enemy heroes.</p>
            <h5>Build 2: Burst Oriented (Risky, High Reward)</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Build Order:</strong> Swift Boots > Blade of Despair > Berserker's Fury > Endless Battle > Malefic Roar > Immortality</li>
                <li><strong>Emblem:</strong> Assassin
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Talent:</strong> Killing Spree (Restore HP and Movement Speed on Kill)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This build is riskier but rewards aggressive players who can secure early kills. More armor penetration lets you deal with tanky opponents. Killing Spree provides better sustain.</p>
            <p><strong>When to Use Which Build:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Build 1:</strong> Use when you need to play it safe, the enemy team has a lot of crowd control, or you need sustained damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Build 2:</strong> Use when you are confident in your ability to outplay the enemy laner, you need to quickly burst down targets, and you have good map awareness to avoid ganks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>III. Counter Items:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Against High Physical Damage (e.g., Aldous, Zilong, Balmond):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Replace Immortality (or Windtalker if you have it) with <img src="images/build items/Blade_Armor.png" alt="Blade Armor"> <strong>Blade Armor</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Against Heavy Magic Damage (e.g., Eudora, Vale, Kagura):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Replace Immortality (or Windtalker if you have it) with <img src="images/build items/Athena's_Shield.png" alt="Athena's Shield"> <strong>Athena's Shield</strong> or <img src="images/build items/Radiant_Armor.png" alt="Radiant Armor"> <strong>Radiant Armor</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Replace Swift Boots with <img src="images/build items/Tough_Boots.png" alt="Tough Boots"> <strong>Tough Boots</strong> (Magic Defense and CC reduction).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Important Considerations:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Item Build Flexibility:</strong> These are example builds. Adapt your item choices based on the specific game situation and enemy team composition.</li>
                <li><strong>Map Awareness:</strong> Granger is vulnerable to ganks, especially in the Gold Lane. Always be aware of the enemy's position and ward strategically.</li>
                <li><strong>Practice Makes Perfect:</strong> Granger has a unique playstyle. Practice in Classic or Custom games to master his skills and item builds.</li>
                <li><strong>Skill Prioritization:</strong> Max Granger's first skill "Rhapsody" for damage and clear speed.</li>
